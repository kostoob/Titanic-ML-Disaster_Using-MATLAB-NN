# Kaggle's Machine Learning Excercise for the Titanic Disaster (using MATLAB)

This machine learning model gives the output for Kaggle's model to predict survivors of the Titanic Disaster. Another repo gives the same outputs using Python, but here we use classical math to make the machine learning model.
